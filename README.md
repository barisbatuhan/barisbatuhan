### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a Research Scientist & Engineer @ [Pixery Labs](https://www.pixerylabs.com/) and currently working on diffusion-based image & character generation and media quality enhancement.
- In September 2022, I graduated from my M.Sc. degree @ KoÃ§ University, [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/). I was a member of [Intelligent User Interfaces](https://iui.ku.edu.tr/) lab and worked on deep detection and recognition models on drawings, comic books, cartoons and animations.

# âš¡ Projects

- [**DASS-Detector:**](https://github.com/barisbatuhan/DASS_Detector) Face & body detection in drawings, comic books, cartoons, etc. Inference code can be also accessed from [this link](https://github.com/barisbatuhan/DASS_Det_Inference). Paper of the project can be viewed from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10641).

- [**Comic Annotator:**](https://github.com/barisbatuhan/ComicAnnotator) An annotator application implemented with Tkinter that is capable of bounding box drawing, character recognition labeling, speech bubble-face-character asssociation, and much more.

- [**Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Comics**](https://github.com/inzva/emotion-recognition-drawings)

- [**Face Generation In Golden Age Comics:**](https://github.com/barisbatuhan/SSuperGAN) Worked on Context-based Face Generation in Golden Age Comics (US Comics between the 1930s-1950s). The model predicts the masked face by giving consecutive comic book panels to the model with a randomly selected face masked at the last frame.

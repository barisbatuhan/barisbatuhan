### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a M.Sc. Student @ [KUIS AI](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/) - [IUI](https://iui.ku.edu.tr/) labs and currently working on deep detection and recognition models on drawings, comic books, cartoons and animations.

# âš¡ Projects

- [**DASS-Det:**](https://github.com/barisbatuhan/FaceDetector) Face & body detection in drawings, comic books, cartoons, etc. (Link belongs to a preliminary study, will be updated soon.)

- [**Comic Annotator:**](https://github.com/barisbatuhan/ComicAnnotator) An annotator application implemented with Tkinter that is capable of bounding box drawing, character recognition labeling, speech bubble-face-character asssociation, and much more.

- [**Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Comics**](https://github.com/inzva/emotion-recognition-drawings)

- [**Face Generation In Golden Age Comics:**](https://github.com/barisbatuhan/SSuperGAN) Worked on Context-based Face Generation in Golden Age Comics (US Comics between the 1930s-1950s). The model predicts the masked face by giving consecutive comic book panels to the model with a randomly selected face masked at the last frame.

# âš¡ Projects

- [**DASS-Det:**](https://github.com/barisbatuhan/FaceDetector) Face & body detection in drawings, comic books, cartoons, etc. (Link belongs to a preliminary study, will be updated soon.)

- [**Multimodal Emotion Recognitition in Comics**](https://github.com/inzva/emotion-recognition-drawings)

- [**Face Generation In Golden Age Comics:**] Worked on Context-based Face Generation in Golden Age Comics (US Comics between the 1930s-1950s). The model predicts the masked face by giving consecutive comic book panels to the model with a randomly selected face masked at the last frame.
